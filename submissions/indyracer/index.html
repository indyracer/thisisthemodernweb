<!--add background to the trip, who, where, why, when-->
  <p>About a year ago, my wife Susan started talking about doing a family vacation.  We’ve heard from a number of friend that a Disney Cruise was an amazing experience.  So we started doing some research and as we got further into it, the more excited we got.  After much discussion and financial calculations, we made the plans in October.  We held off telling our boys, Zach and Josh, until about 3 weeks prior to the trip.  Needless to say, they were extremely excited to hear about our plans.</p>

<p>So in late April we packed our bags and headed down to Florida to catch the cruise.  We’re excited to share some pictures and experiences that will last us a lifetime….or at least until we can save up for the next one!

        <h3>First Day In Florida</h3>

          <p>On Sunday we woke early and raced to the airport for an early flight down to Orlando.  From there we rented a car and drove over to Cocoa Beach.  It’s always a good idea to fly down the day before your cruise incase there’s any travel issues.  Last thing you want to do is have a delayed flight then miss the boat!</p>
          <br>
          <p>Our cruise was embarking at Port Canaveral, on the east coast of Florida.  Once we got to Cocoa Beach, we spent the afternoon at a Courtyard by Marriott hanging out at the pool and walking along the beach.  For dinner, we went to a kid friendly place that served hot dogs, hamburgers, beer and assorted bar food.  After that, it was over to the world’s biggest Ron Jon Surf store, putt putt golf and ice cream.  We were up a bit later than usual with the excitement of the cruise.</p>
