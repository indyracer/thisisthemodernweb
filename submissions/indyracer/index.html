<!--add background to the trip, who, where, why, when-->
  <p>About a year ago, my wife Susan started talking about doing a family vacation.  We’ve heard from a number of friend that a Disney Cruise was an amazing experience.  So we started doing some research and as we got further into it, the more excited we got.  After much discussion and financial calculations, we made the plans in October.  We held off telling our boys, Zach and Josh, until about 3 weeks prior to the trip.  Needless to say, they were extremely excited to hear about our plans.</p>

<p>So in late April we packed our bags and headed down to Florida to catch the cruise.  We’re excited to share some pictures and experiences that will last us a lifetime….or at least until we can save up for the next one!

        <h3>Our Day In Florida</h3>
        <article>
          <p>On Sunday we woke early and raced to the airport for an early flight down to Orlando.  From there we rented a car and drove over to Cocoa Beach.  It’s always a good idea to fly down the day before your cruise incase there’s any travel issues.  Last thing you want to do is have a delayed flight then miss the boat!</p>
          <p>Our cruise was embarking at Port Canaveral, on the east coast of Florida.  Once we got to Cocoa Beach, we spent the afternoon at a Courtyard by Marriott hanging out at the pool and walking along the beach.  For dinner, we went to a kid friendly place that served hot dogs, hamburgers, beer and assorted bar food.  After that, it was over to the world’s biggest Ron Jon Surf store, putt putt golf and ice cream.  We were up a bit later than usual with the excitement of the cruise.</p>

      <h3>First Day on Disney Dream</h3>
      <article>
        <p>On Monday we woke up ready to get on the boat!  Had a quick breakfast at the local IHOP and off to Port Canaveral.  Being our first cruise, we weren’t exactly sure how the boarding experience worked.  But after a few long lines, checking in and waiting we finally were aboard the ship around 12:30 pm.  The room wouldn’t be ready until 1:30, so we headed up to the 11th deck where the main pool and buffet are located.  We’d heard about buffets and cruises and this one didn’t disappoint!  The boys were happy with the tried and true:  pizza, chicken tenders and French fries (this will become a theme of meal time).  For the grown ups, it was stone crab claws and jumbo shrimp!</p>
        <p>After lunch we took our swim suits out of our backpacks and changed for a dip in the pool.  It’s awesome, they have swim vest and kids float in the pool watching movies all day.  After a while it was time to head to the room to drop our bags and go explore the rest of the ship.  We found our way around and more importantly, found the Oceanaires Club.  This is the place where kids get to hang out, play various games, do arts and crafts…basically have fun away from mom and dad!  Disney has a very elaborate and extensive supervision program.  Plus once the kids go in, they very rarely want to leave! </p>
        <p>We were scheduled for the first dinner seating, which meant early dinner.  So we showered up and headed to our appointed restaurant.  There are three main restaurants on the ship and you rotate through them during the cruise.  What’s really cool is your servers rotate with you!  So you see them every night and they get to know your likes and dislikes.  Naduk was our server and by the second day knew exactly what Josh was going to have:  chicken nuggets, fries and fruit.</p>
