					<h2><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/john-donut-saint-louis" class= yelp>John Donut Apple </a></h2>
						<p>A well-loved institution of St. Louis, MO whose very name conjures diabetes and epic Harold and Kumar-esque pilgrimages when the clock strikes 11PM, Sun - Fri. The signature apple fritter donut tastes best hot, oven-fresh, and against the backdrop of Mr. John Donut's sassy remarks.</p>

					<h2>Jay's Greek Salad</h2>
					<p>Fresh made blocks of feta cheese are sold at rock bottom prices at Jay's International Grocery Store, food mecca for all cultures of people who live in the surrounding St. Louis, MO neighborhoods. Chef = yours truly. Satisfaction levels reached another level after a week of emotional buildup for the complex creamy fresh goodness.</p>

					<h2><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/baileys-range-saint-louis" class = yelp>French Toast Milkshake with Fries</a></h2>
					<p>Imagine slurping a milkshake where you can feel the maple syrup swirled perfectly into sweet goodness complete with french toast and cone pieces throughout. Then dip perfect hot crispy fries into it. Weep. Repeat. Bailey's Range, St. Louis, MO.</p>

					<h2><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/xian-famous-foods-new-york-4" class = yelp>Xi'an Buckwheat Noodles</a></h2>
					<p>Homage to Muslim-influenced Western Chinese cuisine from Xi'an province, Xi'an Famous Foods in NYC makes your mind and body crave noodles. Handmade using buckwheat and several choices of spicy sauces, the chewy "Q texture" and flavors are both one-of-a-kind and wholly addictive. A favorite of food mogul Anthony Bourdain.</p>

					<h2>Crawfish Nachos</h2>
					<p>Only 1 known person, after over 100 miles of cycling, finished an order of these babies from Not Yo Mama's Kitchen in New Roads, Louisiana. Then, there is me and my girlfriends on a road trip. Each topping was cooked to stand alone in utter delectiblity. When combined, sent fireworks into the sky and ladies under the table. Never underestimate gas station restaurants in rural America.</p>

					<h2>Ceviche de Pulpo</h2>
					<p>Picture it: A quiet, open-aired, family owned eatery straddling calm waves and the sandy shore in the Ecuadorian fishing town, Puerto Lopez. At daybreak, you watched the boats come to shore, expert fishermen haul in the night's catch, and fill the beach with scavenging birds, fish scales, and the blood of butchered marlins.
					At sunset you eat the freshest and  most perfectly balanced flavors and textures you have ever known and most of the world will never know. Citrus, cilantro, avocado, and the final victorious element -- pasta de man&#237;. This is octopus ceviche.
					    <h3>...Simplemente magn&#237;fico.</h3>
