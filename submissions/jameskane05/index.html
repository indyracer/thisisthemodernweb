					<h3><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

					<p>I just handed in a sizable cash donation to a Ferguson church near Canfield Apartments — revenue from two impromptu benefit shows by Cat Power and The Dirty Delta Blues Band held Sunday, August 24 in St. Louis at The Firebird.</p>
					<p>Chan Marshall, Cat Power’s singer, songwriter and creative center of gravity, wanted to deliver the proceeds personally on Monday, but we arrived to find the worship hall locked up and empty. The congregation was away attending Michael Brown’s funeral services that morning.</p>
					<p>Marshall thrust the thick envelope into my hands. She needed to get to the airport.</p>
					<p>“Can you bring this back tomorrow? Are you mad at me?” she asked. I said it was no problem, I’d be honored. We drove to Lambert and talked.</p>
					<p>We’d only been introduced the day before, but Marshall had reason to trust me. Her label put us in touch because I’m a writer and musician who’s lived in North St. Louis County nearly all my life. I stayed a block from the Ferguson police station until this May, and wrote about my experiences there for Paste magazine in August. I wanted to ask Marshall why she’d come here. I think I know now.</p>
					<p>The pastor received the money and a duffel of supplies as a blessing — everything but roughly 30 packs of cigarettes furnished by Marshall for stressed out, chain-smoking protesters. I promptly distributed these directly to the people.</p>

					<h3><a id="leadup">The lead up</a></h3>
					<p>Marshall was the sole instigator and financial backer of the events Sunday. I met her and her French bulldog/spirit animal Mona in their hotel room that afternoon. Marshall learned of Brown’s death in Ferguson via social media while laid out in a hospital bed after returning ill and dispirited from Cape Town, South Africa — “a whole ‘nother interview,” she tells me. The news hit her in the chest.</p>
					<p>“I went through all the emotions you feel,” says Marshall. “I don’t have the depth of the emotion of knowing what that feels like to lose my son, or knowing the multi-generational breakdown of infrastructure for black America and all of that stuff. I don’t know what that’s like. But the range of emotions I had was my personal range of them. And that’s when I thought, well, maybe I could go and play a show there?”</p>
					<p>Though the line-up changed throughout the weekend, Firebird staff confirmed the event Friday night.</p>
					<p>On a prayer and less than 24 hours’ notice, Marshall flew musicians in from Los Angeles and New York and put them up in hotel rooms. She summoned a professional photographer from vacation in the Florida Keys. She rented cars and top-notch backline amps and drums from St. Louis-based Coda Music Company.</p>
					<p>“All the other thoughts come with that,” she said. “’Can I get Eddie Vedder, Patti Smith, Bono?’ You know, thinking big.” She tweeted at Questlove and President Obama, too.</p>
					<p>In fact, Marshall’s promotion was all social media-based: Facebook events, Instagram pics, tweets and retweets in ALL CAPS, as is Marshall’s wont. In a post that night, she announced that all profits “WILL GO TO HELP PROTESTERS GET OUT OF JAIL &amp; ANY NEED SUPPLIES &amp; FOOD FOR PROTESTERS &amp; FLOWERS FOR RIFLES #peace #ferguson #standup #america #responsibility #tripartisan #occupy #occuparty.”</p>
					<p>Marshall says back-and-forth texting led to brief bouts of miscommunication. The shows were intended to be donation-only, not ticketed events, but Ticketfly, the Firebird’s online vendor, doesn’t allow for such flexible pricing schemes. Matador, her record label, wasn’t even sure it was happening when we first made contact.</p>
					<p>“I actually didn’t think it would get pulled off,” Marshall admitted.</p>

					<p>Nevertheless, by the time doors opened at 4pm, more than 100 St. Louisans had taken refuge in the dimly lit, air-conditioned confines of the Firebird as temperatures outside reached a sweltering 97 degrees. The benefit was open to all ages: one particularly cool dad had a daughter and two young sons and in tow, each wide-eyed and engaged, heads on swivels.</p>
					<p>Marshall’s solo set was a display of vocal prowess and solid instrumental rhythm. She jumped between guitar and piano, doing both original material and covers, fretting over every detail. She harped on vocal effects and equalization, marking the ends of several songs by immediately addressing the soundman, firing off an “are-you-mad-at-me” before the appreciative (if not quite packed) house even has a chance to respond.</p>
					<p>When it’s their turn to set up, The Dirty Delta Blues Band goes to work. Erik Papparazzi (guitar), Gregg Foreman (keys), Nico Turner (bass), Ailanna Kalaba and Jim White (splitting time on drums) shift line-ups and tweak rented amplifiers mid-soundcheck. The group hasn’t toured as Cat Power in more than a year, but within minutes they’re riffing, laughing, at ease. Marshall is ecstatic.</p>

					<p>The band opens with The Everly Brothers’ “All I Have to Do Is Dream.” They don’t bat an eyelash when their singer sneaks offstage mid-performance to corral little Mona back into the green room. The groove keeps going, and Marshall returns to play songs from Cat Power’s most recent full-length, 2012’s Sun. She covers Billie Holliday and The Velvet Underground while wielding dual microphones, doubling her vocal. She still isn’t quite satisfied with the reverb on the monitors, of course.</p>
					<p>This kind of perfectionism can be stressful for her, clearly, and it may be born of insecurity — but that’s Marshall’s process, for better or worse, and it works. Whatever she heard onstage, the audience heard a veteran group of talented blues, rock and pop musicians getting reacquainted.</p>

					<h3><a id="whatsnext">What's next</a></h3>
					<p>At a sandwich shop outside Lambert’s TSA security checkpoint Monday, Marshall said she was glad she’d come, and I agreed. She explained she’d spent more to make the performances happen than she raised in donations, but stressed action as the important thing.</p>
					<p>“You can throw all the money in the world at a problem,” she said. “The only reason I did it, the only goal was to pull this off. I saw that a lot of people came. In my heart, in my mind, seeing that people came, I was so happy. They didn’t have to come. Like, last night at the second show, that was such a wave of relief. Because seeing the young people, like the girl with the punk shirt, with the word ‘punk’ on it — she was like 15?” </p>
					<p>Marshall speaks of young people often and fondly. She frees Mona to bound unleashed around a few little kids at the Ferguson church, and again later at the airport departure terminal.</p>
					<p>She repeatedly brings up Occuparty, a political offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement, and even branded Sunday’s events an Occuparty #showofsupport. She says one of the collective’s tactics, the street summit, is perfect for Ferguson right now.</p>

					<h4>Latest Release: <em>Sun</em></h4>
					<p><em>Sun</em> is the ninth studio album by American musician Cat Power. Her first album of all-original material since 2006's The Greatest, it was released on September 3, 2012, in the United Kingdom and in the United States on September 4, 2012, via Matador Records. The album was issued in a variety of formats, including a limited edition deluxe LP containing a 7" vinyl of bonus tracks.</p>

					<p>“It’s almost like a debate team,” she explained, or like a musical chairs-style series of short discussions. “Okay, this person has the floor, now this person has the floor. OK, done, move that way. Everybody’s confronting everybody about everything. The place where it needs to happen in the streets is here.”</p>
					<p>Marshall thinks the Occuparty can become a viable third option in American politics locally and nationally. She sees too much overlap and conflict of interest in a failing two-party system.</p>
					<p>“I think Americans feel ashamed, invalidated, powerless,” she said, and “extremely disappointed in the American system. We felt what we felt when Bush was president for two terms, and when we heard there was a ‘change’ and stuff, we sat on our hands again.”</p>
					<p>Marshall recognizes other large-scale patterns in socioeconomic and political schema worldwide. Issues of social justice around the globe seem to weigh on her greatly. “After getting sick and being in the fucking hospital and not getting support from where I should have been getting support,” she said, “I learned something that they don’t teach you in school, they don’t teach you on the news. What they do is, ‘We gotta keep ‘em fat, stupid, sick. Just keep ‘em fucking under.’ That goes with our textbooks, public schools. That creates sickness in your head and your heart.” She says her life was saved by homeopathic medicine.</p>
					<p>Marshall also says she has a hard time accepting acknowledgement from her friends. She thinks they worry about her and see signs of mania. “People say, ‘Oh, Chan? She’s crazy.’”</p>
					<p>Suffice it to say, Marshall is an open book. Accordingly, her personal life has been well documented in over 20 years as an artist, both by herself and a sometimes over-eager press, leading to media prognostication of which Marshall seems understandably wary.</p>
					<p>Yet there we were, still talking as she queued up for a TSA screening. She wound her way through the roped-off line and became harder to hear. I thanked her one more time and turned to go.</p>
					<p>It’s obvious Chan Marshall’s unusual. That is, she’s different, unlike anyone I’ve ever met: totally kind and just as talented. When she came to St. Louis, she put her money where her mouth is. She was thankful that people showed up, because they didn’t have to — but then, neither did she.</p>
