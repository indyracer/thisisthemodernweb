# This is the Modern Web
(In David Malan voice...)

###A starter project for those looking to learn HTML5, CSS3 and responsive design.

This is a three-part progressive exercise. Start by following the setup instructions below and then jump into [This is HTML5](https://github.com/launchcode-rebootu/thisisthemodernweb/tree/gh-pages/thisishtml5).

####Quick access to each section:
* [This is HTML5](https://github.com/launchcode-rebootu/thisisthemodernweb/tree/gh-pages/thisishtml5)
* [This is CSS3](https://github.com/launchcode-rebootu/thisisthemodernweb/tree/gh-pages/thisiscss3)
* [This is Responsiveness](https://github.com/launchcode-rebootu/thisisthemodernweb/tree/gh-pages/thisisresponsiveness)

###Getting ready

1. If you are new to Git and GitHub, go through the [Git-it tutorial](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) to get acclimated. I like this tutorial best because it has you actually working on your machine with all of the real-world packages, while also being relatively simple to get running on all operating systems.
2. Fork the [This is the Modern Web repo](https://github.com/launchcode-rebootu/thisisthemodernweb) ([remember how?](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)), and clone it to your local machine, wherever you choose on your file system.
3. In the `submissions` directory, create a new directory with the same name as your GitHub username.
4. Jump down into this new directory, and create and open a new file, `index.html`. Add a single line and save: `<p>YOUR NAME</p>`
5. In Terminal, from the project root folder run `git add .` to stage your new files. Then commit and push them to your fork. When pushing, note that you're on the `gh-pages` branch of the project, not `master` (as you'll often be, and will see most often in documentation). So push using `git push origin gh-pages`.
6. You should be able to view your page live at http://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/thisisthemodernweb/submissions/&lt;username&gt;/. This may take a few minutes to propogate, so if you don't see it right away, try again later. This is the magic of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
